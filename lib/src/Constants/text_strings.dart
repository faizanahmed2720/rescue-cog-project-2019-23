Clean and disinfect surfaces requently, especially those which are regularly touched, such as door handles, faucets and phone screens.\n'
    'What to do if you feel unwell\n'

    'Know the full range of symptoms of COVID-19. The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, dry cough, tiredness and loss of taste or smell. Less common symptoms include aches and pains, headache, sore throat, red or irritated eyes, diarrhoea,  a skin rash or discolouration of fingers or toes.\n'
